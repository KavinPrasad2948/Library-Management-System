# Library Management System üìö

This project is a Library Management System Admin Dashboard built with React. It allows users to manage books and authors.

## Steps to Set Up and Use the Application

1. **Understanding the Requirements:** Carefully read the task description and requirements to understand what needs to be achieved.

2. **Set Up Environment:** Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. Create a new React application using create-react-app or any other preferred method.

3. **Create Components:** Split the code into separate components for better organization and reusability. You may create components for BookList, AuthorList, BookForm, AuthorForm, etc.

4. **State Management:** Use React's useState hook to manage state for books and authors. Implement functions to add, edit, and delete books and authors.

5. **Form Handling:** Use Formik for form handling and validation. Define validation schemas using Yup for both book and author forms.

6. **Implement UI:** Style the components using CSS or a UI framework like Bootstrap. Ensure responsiveness and user-friendly design.

7. **Testing:** Test each functionality to ensure they work as expected. Validate form submissions and error handling.

8. **Documentation:** Write clear code comments and a README.md file explaining how to run the application, its features, and any other relevant information.

9. **Optimization:** Optimize the code for performance and readability. Consider code refactoring and improvements based on feedback.

10. **Deployment:** Once everything works as intended, deploy the application to a hosting service like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages for public access.
